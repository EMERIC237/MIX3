### Docker naming convention in docker hub
- In docker registry, we have repository (are just folder to keep your images organize in the registry)
- Tags are just to identify the exact image in the repository
Tag=Image name 

```
<username>/repository name:tag
leonardtia/devops-pro-repos:stutendent_registration
```
